//  The code editor has a component with a state that keeps track of the text. 
// It also has a method which allows you to set the text to "You clicked!". 
// However, the method doesn't work because it's using the this keyword that is undefined. 
// Fix it by explicitly binding this to the handleClick() method in the component's constructor.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      text: "Hello"
    };
    // change code below this line
this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
    // change code above this line
  }

    this.setState({
      text: "You clicked!"
